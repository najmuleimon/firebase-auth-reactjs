Steps:
1. Go to firebase console (console.firebase.google.com) and login with google
2. Create a new project and continue
3. (then enter to my project console) Click Web icon
4. Give a web application name and click register
5. (from the given steps) Install firebase in my project using 'npm install firebase' command
(or we can follow the given steps from firebase documentation => docs > build > authentication > web > get started)
6. Now firebase will give some project config code. an object named 'firebaseConfig'
7. Make a file named 'firebase.init.js' in src folder and export it(export default app) to use it in another file
8. In App.js file import app in getAuth() =>
import getAuth from firebase/auth and create const auth = getAuth(app) in App.js
9. Now we will follow the steps of Authentication using google => firebase documentation => docs > build > authentication > web > google
10. Again go tp console.firebase.google.com > Authentication > click get started
11. Here we can see different sign in method options/ sign in provider. 
12. We have to click on google (anyone) and turn on/enable and give a project name and support email address and click save
13. Now we can see that our google authentication sign in provider is enabled in our firebase console project settings.
14. We make a button for login with google and add a click handler with a function in App.js file
15. Create an instance of the Google provider object in App.js file
16. To sign in with a pop-up window, call signInWithPopup inside the declared function and pass (auth , provider) inside the function

17. Now to show logged In user in our UI we can declare a state. From the state variable we can find all the information of user in an object
18. To sign out make a button and set a click handler with a function.
19. inside the function we call signOut from firebase/auth and pass auth in the function.

6. Here we give Application name, homepage URL (localhost url/ live site link), application description, authorization callback url(we can find this in firebase provider enable page)
7. Click on Register. Here we find our client id and generate client secret

firebase docs > build > authentication > web > github
